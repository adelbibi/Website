I am a MSc/PhD student at KAUST (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) advised by Professor Bernard Ghanem. My research interests lie in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Specifically, I aim to tackle challenges of human activity recognition at large scale. I study efficient ways to harvest and annotate massive amount of data depicting human activities.

I received my Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from Kuwait University in July 2014.
